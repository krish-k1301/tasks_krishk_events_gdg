# Tasks_Krish Kubadia_Events_GDG

This repository contains my submissions for the Google Developer Group (GDG) Machine Learning Track.
All tasks are organized using the required branch-based structure. The main branch contains the setup, purpose of the repository, and navigation guide.

## Repository Structure

The repository follows the format specified by the GDG ML mentors:

```
 MAIN BRANCH (setup, overview)
 ├── README.md  ← (this file)
 └── Branches for each task:
        task1/
        task2/
        task3/
        ...
```

Each task branch contains its own:

* Jupyter Notebook(s)
* Supporting code files (if any)
* A task-specific README
* Outputs and analysis

The main branch does **not** contain task code. It is only for navigation and documentation.

## How to Navigate

To access any task:

1. Open the **Branches** dropdown (top left on GitHub)
2. Select the branch named after the task, for example:

   * `task1`
   * `task2`
   * `task3`

Inside each task branch, you will find:

* The complete implementation for that task
* EDA, preprocessing, and model-building steps
* Task explanation and conclusions
* Any generated files or saved notebooks

## Naming Convention

Repository name follows the required format:

```
tasks_<yourname>_<department>_gdg
```

Example:

```
tasks_krishk_Events_gdg
```

Task branches follow:

```
task1
task2
task3
...
```

## Submission Instructions

For each task submission:

* Upload code and notebook to the correct task branch
* Update the task-specific README with explanations
* Submit:

  * The **repository link**
  * The **task branch link**
    (via the Google Form shared by GDG Mentors)

## Purpose

This repository serves as a structured collection of my work throughout the GDG Machine Learning learning path. Each task demonstrates:

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Data preprocessing
* Feature engineering
* Model building
* Insight extraction
* Good coding and documentation practices

## Contact

If you are reviewing this repository and need clarification about any task, feel free to check the task-specific README files for detailed explanations.

If you want, I can now generate the **Task 1 README** too — just say “Make my Task 1 README”.
